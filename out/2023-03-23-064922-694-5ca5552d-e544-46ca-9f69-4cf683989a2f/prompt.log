story
--------------


Dr. Seuss once wrote a story about two unlikely friends, a grumpy Cairn Terrier named Merlin and a fox named Wilbur who thought he was a pig. One day, they decided to go on an adventure to the park. They packed a picnic basket full of treats and set off on their journey. 

As they walked through the park, they saw children playing on the swings and slides. Merlin, being grumpy as usual, didn't want to play with the children. Wilbur, on the other hand, wanted to join in on the fun. 

Merlin sat down on a bench and began to read a book. Wilbur ran off to play with the children. He climbed up the ladder to the slide and slid down with a big smile on his face. 

Suddenly, a gust of wind blew the picnic basket away. Wilbur saw it and ran after it. Merlin, who was too busy reading his book, didn't notice. Wilbur chased the basket all the way to the other side of the park. 

When he caught up to the basket, he found a group of children playing with it. They had found the basket and were having a picnic of their own. Wilbur was sad that he had lost the basket, but he was happy to see the children having fun. 

Merlin eventually got up from the bench and went to find Wilbur. He saw him playing with the children and smiled. He realized that it was okay to have fun and play with others. 

The two friends joined the children for a picnic and had a great time. They ate sandwiches, fruit, and drank lemonade. They even played a game of tag. 

As the sun began to set, the friends said goodbye to the children and headed home. Merlin and Wilbur were tired from their adventure, but they were happy. They had made new friends and had a great time at the park. 

And so, the unlikely friends, Merlin and Wilbur, went on many more adventures together, always remembering the fun they had at the park.

  an example of the output is (for 3 pictures):
  ---
  ["characters go to paris", "merlin orders pastries for everyone", "they enjoy their time immensely"]
  ---
  ensure the number of items in the list equals 3.
  ensure the output contains only a list and no other words or content. Also, no newlines, please.
  I want to save your response in a JS variable.
  The output should be a single array of strings, and each string in the array is one of the key points you generate.
  make each key point very descriptive because I'd like to feed it into Dall-E, an ai image generation model
  that takes prompts and outputs pictures.
  The images should be consistent with each other, but otherwise, feel free to embelish with details
  each prompt should include a description about the characters involved in the corresponding key point
