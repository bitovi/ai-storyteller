Once upon a time, Creamy the Dalmatian and Fawn the baby deer went on a trip to Paris. Creamy was so excited to see all the beautiful tiles she had heard about, but she didn't know anything about floors or how to be a tile. As they explored the city, they came across a grand building with a shiny marble floor. Creamy was amazed by the beautiful tiles and decided to become one herself. She lay down on the floor and tried to blend in with the other tiles. Fawn giggled at Creamy's silly antics and decided to play along. She lay down next to Creamy and pretended to be a tile too. The people walking by were confused by the two animals lying on the ground, but they couldn't help but smile at their playful behavior. Suddenly, a group of children came running into the building. They were on a scavenger hunt and needed to find a picture of a dog and a deer. When they saw Creamy and Fawn lying on the floor, they knew they had found what they were looking for. The children were so happy to have found the picture and thanked Creamy and Fawn for their help. Creamy realized that she didn't need to be a tile to be helpful and make others happy. Fawn hugged Creamy and they continued on their adventure, excited to see what other surprises Paris had in store for them. And so, Creamy and Fawn learned that sometimes the best way to help others is to just be yourself and have fun. The end.
